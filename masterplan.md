# Playto Landing Page - Master Plan

## Overview

**What are we building?**

A responsive, mobile-first landing page for Playto—an all-in-one mobile-first platform that empowers creators, educators, and community leaders to build, grow, and monetize learning communities without needing any technical skills, websites, or third-party tools.

**Why are we building it?**

To introduce Playto to its target audience, clearly communicate its unique value proposition, showcase its core features, and capture early interest by encouraging users to join the waitlist. The landing page will serve as the primary entry point for potential users and set the tone for the brand's mobile-first, creator-friendly approach.

**Who is it for?**

- Instagram creators & influencers building paid or free "inner circles"
- Educators or tutors offering subject-specific community learning
- Freelancers or coaches offering cohort-based programs
- Content creators who want to own their audience and monetize directly
- Passionate hobbyists turning their interests into a tribe

## Core Purpose

The landing page must effectively communicate Playto's core purpose: To make it dead-simple for anyone to launch a paid (or free) community-based course in minutes. It should convey that Playto is a cross between a private club, a course, and a game.

## Use Cases

- A creator discovers Playto via social media, visits the landing page, and quickly understands the platform's value proposition. They join the waitlist to be notified at launch.
- An educator looking for a simple, all-in-one solution to run a cohort-based course lands on the page, explores the features, and signs up for early access.
- A coach compares Playto to competing platforms, sees the clear advantages in the comparison table, and joins the waitlist.
- A hobbyist interested in starting a community for their passion reads the FAQ, feels reassured about the ease of use, and submits their email to join the waitlist.

## Requirements

### General

- The landing page must be fully responsive, optimized primarily for mobile but also functional on desktop.
- Visual style: Modern, clean, engaging with strong CTAs and a mobile-first sensibility.
- All content must reflect Playto's real value proposition and target audience.

## Design Rules

### UI Text & Spacing

#### Line Height
- **Headings**: 
  - Use a line height of 1.1 to 1.3 times the text size
  - As heading size increases, line height should decrease
- **Body Text**: 
  - Use a line height of 1.3 to 1.5 times the text size
  - As text size increases, line height decreases

#### Letter Spacing
- **Headings**: 
  - Consider using negative letter spacing (-1% to -2%) for a crisp look
  - If it looks too tight, use a smaller negative percentage
- **Body Text**: 
  - Be cautious with negative letter spacing as it can reduce readability

#### Text Alignment
- **Long Paragraphs** (more than 3 lines): 
  - Use left alignment for better reading speed
- **Headings & Short Text Chunks**: 
  - Center alignment is acceptable
- **Consistency**: 
  - Avoid mixing alignments between headings and body text

#### Text Width (Line Length)
- **Body Text**: 
  - Aim for 50 to 75 characters per line
- **Desktop** (approx. 18px paragraph text): 
  - A text width of around 600 pixels is a good guideline
- **Avoid Long Lines**: 
  - These can be intimidating and discourage users from reading

#### Hierarchy in Text
- **Font Sizes for Hierarchy**: 
  - Limit the use of different font sizes; ideally stick to just two
- **Alternative Hierarchy Indicators**: 
  - Use font weight and subtle color changes, not just text size

#### Spacing & Relationships (White Space)
- **White Space is Active**: 
  - Treat white space as an active element, not just passive background
- **Principle of Proximity**: 
  - Elements with a closer relationship should have less space between them
  - Elements with a weaker relationship should have more space between them
- **Spacing Multiplier System**: 
  - Closely related elements = 1x spacing
  - Less related elements = 2x spacing
  - Distinct sections = 3x or 4x spacing
